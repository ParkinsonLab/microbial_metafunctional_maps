# BCB430 - Minh An Ho

## Description
* To run the current visualization, open index.html file
* Data used for input can be found in the ./data folder
* Use ./data/Input.xlsx for input data
* Use ./data/CCInput.xlsx for cellular component data
* Use ./data/FamInput.xlsx for family ratio data

## Currently implemented functions
* Cellular component selection and filtering
* Functional category display

## Future directions
* Dynamic visualization of sub networks under functional category headers
* Individual nodes labelled with selected reference species
* Pie chart colouring of nodes corresponding to family composition (top 10 represented)
* Pie chart representation of family composition across all nodes with corresponding legend
